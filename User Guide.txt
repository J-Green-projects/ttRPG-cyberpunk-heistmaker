These two programs are designed to automatically generate jobs for player characters in a cyberpunk dystopian future.
cyberpunkHeistGen.py generates heists for would-be antiheroic theives and assassins.
cyberpunkMercContractGen.py generates contracts for the security corporations that oppose those antiheroes.

These programs are paired, the idea being that they represent two sides of the same coin, even using the same input data.
However, since they perform different operations, your mileage may vary when going outside of suggested ranges for values.
The programs have separate README files since it is unlikely for one GM to need both.
